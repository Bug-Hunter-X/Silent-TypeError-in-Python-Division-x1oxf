This repository demonstrates a subtle and uncommon error in Python. The `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to handle exceptions during division. However, if a non-numeric type is passed as the divisor, it does not raise a TypeError, it silently return `None`. This is unusual behavior that may not be readily apparent during development, making it crucial to understand and document these types of conditions. The solution showcases a more robust way to handle type errors in this function.
